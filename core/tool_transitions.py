"""Tool-level lifecycle-state transition validation.

Mirrors `core/lifecycle_store/transitions.py` for the Request folder-
state machine. Per blueprint-v2 §D audit and DECISIONS
`[2026-04-25 Fix Day 2]`, the `Tool.lifecycle_state` column is the
**third** state machine in the Concierge data model (distinct from
Request folder state and Request status field). Its vocabulary
(`discovered` / `pending` / `used` / `loaded-on-boot` / `retired` /
`pending-decision` / `on-demand`) captures how a catalog entry moves
from candidacy through usage to retirement; this module defines the
legal transitions between those states and enforces them on every
ORM write.

**Enforcement strategy — hybrid (per Fix Day 3 Fork 1 ruling):**

1. Service method `transition_tool_lifecycle(session, tool, new_state)`
   is the canonical write path. Callers that go through the service
   get an explicit failure locus in tests and logs when a transition
   is illegal.

2. SQLAlchemy `before_update` event listener on `Tool` fires on every
   ORM write to `lifecycle_state`, raising the same exception if the
   transition is illegal. Belt-and-suspenders — callers that do bare
   `tool.lifecycle_state = X; session.flush()` still hit validation
   and can't silently bypass it.

**Intentional bypass — Alembic migrations + audited backfills.**
Validation fires on SQLAlchemy ORM writes. Intentional bypass via raw
SQL UPDATE is reserved for Alembic migrations and audited backfills
(precedent: Fix Day 2 migration `2fe7a135d9dd` backfilled
`lifecycle_state` across 48 rows using `op.execute(...UPDATE...)`
rather than ORM transitions). Future sessions needing to override
lifecycle state at scale should use the same raw-SQL-in-migration
pattern, log the mapping rationale in DECISIONS.md, and cite this
paragraph as the explicit-by-design precedent.

**Initial inserts** are not validated — a Tool can be created in any
lifecycle_state (skills ingest creates rows at `discovered`; catalog
ingest creates rows at `loaded-on-boot` or `discovered` based on the
source's active/in-manifest signal). Validation only gates *updates*.

---

## Skills-specific lifecycle semantics (Fix Day 3 Task 4)

Skills (`tool_type='skill'`) share the same six-state enum as MCP /
CLI / HTTP tools, but the state labels carry slightly different
semantics because skills are ambient-loaded (no per-session install,
no explicit load step):

- **`discovered`** — default state on first ingest. The SKILL.md
  exists under `<skills_root>/{public,user,examples}/<slug>/` and
  Concierge knows about it, but no session has demonstrably exercised
  it (no `UsageEvent(event_type='used')` row referencing the skill).
  A skill can also fall back to `discovered` if its loaded-on-boot /
  used status is later revoked (via a transition into `discovered`).
- **`pending`** — reserved for the request-pipeline lifecycle; does
  not apply to skills directly (skills don't go through
  `concierge_request_tool` — they're catalogued from disk). A skill
  should normally never hold `pending`; landing there is a bug.
- **`used`** — the skill has been exercised in at least one session.
  Defined operationally as: Claude referenced the skill's instructions
  in a response (observed via the skill's inclusion in Claude's
  active-tools list at recommendation time), OR the skill's
  `description` contributed to a tool-selection decision (observed via
  a memory hit on `tool-selection` tags that names the skill). The
  Fix Day 4 scanner + telemetry surfaces will instrument both signals;
  until then, skills transition to `used` only via explicit operator
  action or direct test fixtures.
- **`loaded-on-boot`** — skill is pinned for proactive surfacing. The
  `ambient_loading=True` flag set at ingest is NOT the same as
  `loaded-on-boot`: ambient_loading says "SKILL.md's trigger
  conditions load it into context when matched," whereas
  loaded-on-boot says "the operator has decided this skill is
  sufficiently load-bearing that its summary belongs in the identity
  note and weekly-review cadence." The default for newly-ingested
  skills is ambient_loading=True, lifecycle_state=discovered —
  trigger-loadable but not operator-pinned.
- **`retired`** — operator explicitly demoted the skill. The SKILL.md
  may still exist on disk; retired just means "don't surface this in
  recommendations." Reinstating requires the standard
  retired → discovered two-step (see `_TRANSITIONS` below).

**What "used" does NOT mean for skills:** merely reading the SKILL.md
frontmatter at ingest time is not "used." Ingest is a catalog-level
operation; "used" is a session-level operation. The distinction
matters for the §C7 promotion/demotion scanner's aggregation query —
if ingest counted as usage, every skill would be perpetually
"recently used" and the promotion signal would collapse.
